## LLNL SLURM SPANK plugins ##

This package contains several SLURM SPANK plugins
developed and used at LLNL. These are all drop-in
plugins that enhance and extend the functionality
of SLURM for users and administrators, and are hosted
here not only so that others may use these plugins
directly, but also as good examples of what kind of
features and functionality may be developed with the
spank plugin framework for slurm.

Some of the plugins in this package are LLNL-specific,
in that they require LLNL-only modifications to the
software stack. However, the code for these plugins
is still provided for demonstrative purposes.

Also see the top-level [README](http://slurm-spank-plugins.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README).
