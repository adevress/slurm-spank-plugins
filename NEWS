Version 0.34 (2008-09-25):
- auto-affinity: Fix for using auto-affinity module with jobs using
   --use-cpusets=task. The auto-affinity module now checks to make sure
   CPU mask has not changed in task context, and if so, silently
   does nothing.
- preserve-env: New plugin which, when enabled with --preserve-slurm-env
   option, will attempt to keep the remote SLURM_* environment variables
   the same as in the current context. Useful for invoking 
   "srun -n1 --pty bash" from within an allocation shell.

Version 0.33 (2008-09-11):
- Fix for critical locking bug in cpuset plugin. The cpuset plugin
   now uses a global lockfile in /var/lock instead of locking files
   under /dev/cpuset. 
- Fix for generation of SLURM_CMDLINE in use-env plugin.

Version 0.32 (2008-08-21):
- oom-detect: Optionally log OOM killed jobs via syslog(3), if
   the do_syslog parameter is used in plugstack.conf. The syslog
   message has the form "slurmd: OOM detected: jobid=JOBID uid=UID"

Version 0.31 (2008-08-19):
- oom-detect: Delay slightly if an OOM killed process is detected
   to give the error message time to make it to srun stderr.

Version 0.30 (2008-08-04):
- cpuset: Slightly improve config file error messages.
- cpuset: Minor fixes for man pages.
- auto-affinity: Update --auto-affinity=help message.

Version 0.29 (2008-07-29):
- cpuset: Major overhaul of SLURM cpuset support. Now includes a PAM
   module, pam_slurm_cpuset.so, and a global config file in 
   /etc/slurm/slurm-cpuset.conf. For more information, see the 
   new manual pages included with the distribution.
- auto-affinity: Do not set CPU affinity by default if the number
   of available CPUs is not evenly divisible by the number of tasks.

Version 0.28 (2008-07-22):
- auto-affinity: Fix error where spank_post_opt hook was incorrectly
   run in srun, which caused an immediate error and abort.

Version 0.27 (2008-07-16):
- cpuset: Expand cpuset support to per-task cpusets via --use-cpusets=tasks.

Version 0.26 (2008-07-16):
- cpuset: Add support for per-job-step cpusets via the new srun option
   '--use-cpusets'. See the README or --use-cpusets=help for more information.
- auto-affinity: Delay detection of current cpuset until after user
   option processing in the event that user option changed our cpuset.

Version 0.25 (2008-07-10):
- cpuset: Added cpuset plugin to constrain jobs to number of CPUs 
   allocated on shared, but not oversubscribed nodes. 
- auto-affinity: Make auto-affinity plugin cpuset-aware. CPU affinity
   is assigned as if the job were running on a node the size of the
   current cpuset. If cpusets are not enabled, the auto-affinity behavior
   is unchanged.

Version 0.24 (2008-06-10):
 - auto-affinity: Query SLURM controller for number of CPUs allocated
    to the current job in exclusive_only mode if the environment variable
    SLURM_JOB_CPUS_PER_NODE is not set.

Version 0.23 (2008-06-10):
 - auto-affinity: Add 'exclusive_only' flag to auto-affinity plugin 
    to constrain plugin activity to only those jobs that have exclusive
    use of the current node.
