Version 0.13 (2010-08-19):
 - auto-affinity: Add cpus= and masks= options to allow manual
   mapping of tasks to CPUs.

Version 0.12 (2010-03-08):
 - Fix unchecked return from slurm_load_jobs(3) in cpuset code.

Version 0.11 (2010-03-07):
 - Fix segfault in spank/lua due to lua stack overflow.
 - Fix use-env segv when exit hook called before init.
 - Fixes for spank/cpuset use with slurm-2.1.

Version 0.10 (2009-12-21):
 - Fix segfault in spank/lua when no lua scripts are configured.

Version 0.9 (2009-12-16):
 - Added lua plugin.

 - Added statfs(1) after mount in private-mount plugin.

Version 0.6 (2009-04-23):
 - Added private-mount plugin (llnl subpackage).

Version 0.5 (2009-03-13):
 - auto-affinity: Don't assume any correspondence between CPU
    logical ID and CPU physical location (i.e. socket). This fixes
    poor CPU assignment on systems where CPUs are not necessarily
    sequentially numbered.
 - The preserve-env plugin is no longer packaged automatically
    with the slurm-spank-plugins RPM. This functionality is now
    available in SLURM directly as of SLURM 1.4.
 - Don't include oom-detect in the base slurm-spank-plugins RPM,
    it belongs in the llnl-specific RPM only.
   
Version 0.4 (2008-10-09):
 - preserve-env: Fix slurmstepd crash when dealing with environment
    variables larger than 64B (a very common case). The plugin now
    uses dynamic instead of static buffers.

Version 0.3 (2008-10-06):
 - Fix RPM build without cpuset and llnl subpackages.

Version 0.2 (2008-10-06):
 - slurm-spank-plugins RPMs now obsolete chaos-spankings RPMs.
